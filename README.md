# coffee_card

coffee_card is my first Flutter project to learn the basics of Flutter. This is a stepping stone to my independant Task.me project where I create a Task Management tool using Flutter.

# What I learned

I learned how to...
- Import dart and img files
- How to add buttons
- The difference between Stateless and Stateful Widgets
- What Widgets are
- How to use and manipulate rows and columns
- Control flow in lists
- Reusable Widgets
